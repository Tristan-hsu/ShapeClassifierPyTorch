    "\n",
    "A. We assume that gender is the confounding factor, which meanes that we should control the gender factor to see the direct effect of drug on disease. In such case, the model should set gender as an exogenous parameter and compare non-disease rate to measure the treatment effect. To model it in a non-parametric way, I set gender factor as the given condition and use difference of disease conditional probability to measure treatment effect.    \n",

    "These two sets of results exhibit slight discrepancies, which raises the question of whether the gender effect might encompass other unknown influences. If further research does not establish gender as a mediator, it should be treated as a confounding factor. Under the confounder assumption, gender is simply one influence that can be controlled for, and thus there is no need to assume independence between the gender effect and the drug effect. This leaves room for other unknown factors to exert an influence on the drug’s efficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if gender is posited as a mediator, one must assume that the gender effect is independent of the drug’s direct effect. In this scenario, any other unknown factor that is indirectly influenced by the drug and subsequently affects the treatment outcome would be subsumed under the gender effect. Although this does not alter the direction of the treatment effect relative to the confounder assumption, it implies a more substantial and specific relationship between gender and the drug.\n",
